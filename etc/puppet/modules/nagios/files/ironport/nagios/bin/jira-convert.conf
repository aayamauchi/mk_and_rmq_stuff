# all other sections (except the DEFAULT) are configuration for projects queue in JIRA
# section name should be equal to project identifier in ticket ID

# project section can contain following parameters:
#  closing_action        - final step name to resolve or close the ticket
#  closing_action_args   - additional parameters for resolving/closing the ticket in queue
#  before_closing_action - complete Jira client action string with action to be taken before resolving/closing the ticket
#  after_closing_action  - complete Jira client action string with action to be taken after resolving/closing the ticket
#
# when project has additional required workflow steps (workflow does not allow to resolve/close ticket with status 'New')
# required workflow steps should be specified in the 'workflow_steps' parameter. This parameter should contain final resolve/close
# step at the end of steps list.
# when project does not have additional required steps please do not specify this parameter because it lead to additional execution of Jira client
#
# when workflow_steps is specified additional parameters can be specified. There are:
#  STEPNAME_before_action - complete Jira client action string with action to be taken after progressing the ticket
#  STEPNAME_after_action  - complete Jira client action string with action to be taken before progressing the ticket
#  STEPNAME_action_args   - additional parameters for progressing the ticket in queue
#    where STEPNAME is made from specified in the workflow_steps step name after replacing spaces to _ and removing all special chars
#    for example 'Assign to Me & Investigate'   -> assign_to_me__investigate
#                'Request Delay (Freeze Issue)' -> request_delay_freeze_issue

# before and after actions parameters values are passed through the 'subst' command and '$issueID' is replaced by processing ticket ID
# so be careful when using '$' char in these parameters - jira-convert evaluates '$' as variables
