The spec file content in this directory should represent branches
of publicly available packages.  Using the convention of appending
the release string with ".%{cisco_release}.cisco" ensures that
the locally modified package will always update the unmodified
version of the same package and that there will be no yum repository
conflicts.  Maintaining branch history in this way ensures an
easier path to package updates using a branch merge.

To use:
	1) check out the rpmbuild tree,
	2) add "%_topdir <path to checkout>" to ~/.rpmmacros,
	3) use "rpm -ivh <path to checkout>/SRPMS/<unmodified SRPM>" --
		do NOT use sudo,
	4) modify the *cisco.spec file, as needed -- remember to update
		the changelog,
	5) use "rpmbuild -ba -D'dist .el5' -D'cisco_release <x>' <specfile> --
		the cisco release MUST be incremented to avoid repo conflicts,
	6) after testing, commit changes, and copy the resulting RPM(s) and
		SRPM to the YUM repo and regenerate the metadata.
